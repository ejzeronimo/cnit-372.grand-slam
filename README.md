## Prerequisites
This assumes that there is some hosted SQL server. We were provided one for class so initialization of one is not included.
## Resources
I used this link [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/quickstartnodeonprem.html) to look into raw SQL to Node, though nothing came of it.
## Issues
For any issues please create an issue in this repo and I will try to respond promptly.
